##How do I use it?
Anytime you need a picture, just embed the link:
`http://one-education.org/profile-img/index.php?n=FIRSTNAME%20LASTNAME`

If you want to specify the size, use the r parameter:
`http://one-education.org/profile-img/index.php?n=FIRSTNAME%20LASTNAME&r=500`

You can also chose from the colours orange, green, blue or pink using the c parameter:
`http://one-education.org/profile-img/index.php?n=FIRSTNAME%20LASTNAME&r=500&c=blue`
